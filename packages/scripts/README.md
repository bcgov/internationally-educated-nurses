### Generate milestones for reports

`generate-milestones` creates major milestones for each stage.

- Skip applicants with a job
- Skip applicants registered before 2022-06-01
- Do not create recruitment outcome milestones except `job offer accepted`
- Each milestone's duration is randomly selected between 1 and 10
