# Scripts

This package is meant to hold simple and smaller one-off scripts for various tasks

## Structure

Our scripts up to this point have been used to transform a data source into another format.
The package structure supports this workflow with an input folder: `in` and an output folder: `out`.

```
ğŸ“¦scripts
 â”£ ğŸ“‚in <- Input data files
 â”£ ğŸ“‚out <- Output directory 
 â”£ ğŸ“‚src <- Scripts go here
 â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
 â”— ğŸ“œpackage.json
 ```
