# Accessibility

This package handles automated accessibility using the [axe test runner](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-runner-axe) testing for `@ehpr/web`.

Run tests with `yarn accessibility-test` from this directory or with `yarn workspace @ehpr/accessibility accessibility-test` from the root directory.

Screenshots will be output into `/screenCaptures` for each tested page.
