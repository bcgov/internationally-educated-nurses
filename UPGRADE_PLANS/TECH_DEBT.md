# Technical Debt Analysis - IEN Project

This document catalogs the technical debt identified during dependency upgrade analysis in January 2025.

## Executive Summary

The IEN project has accumulated significant technical debt, primarily around outdated dependencies and version mismatches. Key issues include:

- **Critical**: TypeScript version mismatch (4.3.5 vs 5.7.2) causing unpredictable behavior
- **High**: React 17 dependencies blocking React 18/19 compatibility
- **High**: 78+ database migrations with no compatibility testing for TypeORM 0.3.x
- **Medium**: Outdated type definitions across the stack
- **Medium**: Mixed dependency versions between packages

## 1. Version Mismatch Issues

### TypeScript Version Fragmentation ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Current State**:
- Root: TypeScript 4.3.5
- API: TypeScript 4.3.5
- Common: TypeScript 4.3.5
- Scripts: TypeScript 4.3.5
- Web: TypeScript 5.7.2 ⚠️ **MISMATCH**

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent type checking between packages
- Potential runtime errors from different compilation outputs
- Shared code may behave differently across packages
- IDE features may not work correctly

**Resolution**: Standardize all packages to TypeScript 4.9.5, then plan upgrade to 5.4.4

### React Ecosystem Version Conflicts ⚠️ **HIGH**

**Current State**:
```
react: 18.3.1
react-dom: 18.3.1
@types/react: 17.0.37 (expects React 17)
react-test-renderer: 17.0.2 (expects React 17)
```

**Affected Dependencies**:
- `use-http@1.0.26` - Expects React 16-17
- `react-shallow-renderer@16.14.1` - Expects React 16
- Multiple @radix-ui components with peer dependency warnings

**Impact**:
- Type mismatches causing false TypeScript errors
- Test utilities may not work correctly with React 18 features
- Potential runtime issues with incompatible libraries

## 2. Outdated Core Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies

| Package | Current | Latest Stable | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|---------------|------------|
| @nestjs/core | 9.3.9 | 11.1.2 | Medium |
| @nestjs/typeorm | 8.0.2 | 10.x required for TypeORM 0.3 | High |
| @nestjs/swagger | 5.1.5 | 7.x | Medium |
| TypeORM | 0.2.45 | 0.3.20 | High |
| axios | 0.28.0 | 1.7.0 | Medium |
| pg | 8.11.3 | ✅ Up to date | - |
| jsonwebtoken | 9.0.2 | ✅ Up to date | - |

### Frontend Dependencies

| Package | Current | Latest Stable | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Next.js | 14.2.25 | 15.4 | Low |
| React | 18.3.1 | 19.0 | Medium |
| @types/react | 17.0.37 | 18.3.x | High |
| react-test-renderer | 17.0.2 | 18.3.x | High |
| tailwindcss | 3.4.1 | ✅ Up to date | - |

### Testing Dependencies

| Package | Current | Latest | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| Jest (API) | 27.4.7 | 29.7.0 | Low |
| Jest (Web) | 27.4.2 | 29.7.0 | Low |
| babel-jest | 29.7.0 | ✅ Partially upgraded | - |
| ts-jest | 27.1.2 | 29.x | Medium |

## 3. Security Vulnerabilities

### Express Resolution
- Fixed at 4.19.2 via resolutions to address security vulnerabilities
- Should be monitored for future security updates

### Other Security Resolutions
```json
"resolutions": {
  "axios": "0.28.0",        // Pinned for compatibility
  "express": "4.19.2",      // Security fix
  "postcss": "8.4.31",      // Security fix
  "@babel/traverse": "7.23.2",
  "ws": "7.5.10",
  "braces": "3.0.3",
  "webpack": "5.94.0",
  "semver": "7.5.2",
  "xml2js": "0.5.0",
  "word-wrap": "1.2.4",
  "micromatch": "4.0.8",
  "ip": "2.0.1"
}
```

## 4. Database & ORM Technical Debt

### TypeORM Migration Risk ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**78+ Migration Files** (2021-2025) with no compatibility testing for TypeORM 0.3.x

**Risks**:
- Migration API changes may break existing migrations
- No rollback testing for production migrations
- Complex queries using deprecated patterns
- Repository pattern changes affecting 120+ usage points

### Database Configuration Debt

- Using deprecated `ormconfig.ts` pattern
- Should migrate to DataSource configuration
- Custom naming strategy may need updates
- No migration validation tooling

## 5. Code Quality Issues

### TypeScript `any` Usage ⚠️ **MEDIUM**

**102 instances** of `any` type across 42 files:

Top offenders:
1. `/apps/api/src/applicant/ienapplicant.controller.ts` - 10 usages
2. `/apps/api/src/applicant/external-api.service.ts` - 9 usages
3. `/apps/web/src/services/report.ts` - 9 usages

**Impact**:
- Reduced type safety
- Potential runtime errors
- Harder to refactor safely

### Decorator Heavy Architecture

Heavy reliance on decorators throughout:
- Class-validator decorators
- Class-transformer decorators
- NestJS decorators
- TypeORM decorators

**Risk**: Decorator behavior changes between TypeScript versions

## 6. Build & Development Environment

### Node.js Version
- ✅ Recently upgraded to Node.js 22
- All GitHub Actions updated
- Docker images updated

### Build Times
- API build occasionally times out (>2 minutes)
- May indicate growing complexity or inefficient build process

### Monorepo Management
- Using Yarn workspaces (v4.9.2)
- Mixed TypeScript versions causing cross-package issues
- No consistent versioning strategy across packages

## 7. Testing Infrastructure

### Test Coverage Gaps
- Minimal unit tests (1 API unit test file)
- Limited E2E test coverage (4 files)
- No snapshot tests
- No integration tests for migrations

### Test Tool Mismatches
- Jest versions differ between packages
- babel-jest already at 29.7.0 but jest at 27.4.2
- Test utilities expecting React 17

## 8. Frontend Specific Debt

### React Component Patterns
- Using older Formik (2.4.6) alongside newer react-hook-form (7.53.2)
- Mixed state management patterns
- No consistent form handling approach

### Type Definition Lag
- @types/react at 17.0.37 (very outdated)
- @types/lodash at 4.14.182 (outdated)
- Type definitions not matching runtime versions

## 9. Dependency Resolution Strategy

### Current Resolutions (Forcing Versions)
Using Yarn resolutions to force versions, indicating compatibility issues:
- axios pinned at 0.28.0
- Multiple security-related pins
- Express forced to 4.19.2

This approach masks underlying compatibility problems.

## 10. Recommended Remediation Plan

## Risk Matrix

| Issue | Impact | Likelihood | Priority |
|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| TypeScript version mismatch | High | Current | Critical |
| React 17 type dependencies | High | Current | High |
| TypeORM 0.3 migration compatibility | Very High | High | High |
| Outdated NestJS version | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Jest version mismatch | Low | Current | Medium |
| Any type usage | Medium | Current | Low |

## Monitoring & Metrics

To track technical debt reduction:

1. **Dependency freshness score** - % of dependencies on latest stable
2. **Type coverage** - Reduction in `any` usage count
3. **Test coverage** - Unit/integration/E2E coverage percentages
4. **Build time** - Track and reduce build times
5. **Security vulnerabilities** - Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

The IEN project has accumulated technical debt typical of a multi-year project. The most critical issues are:

1. **TypeScript version mismatch** causing unpredictable behavior
2. **React ecosystem version conflicts** blocking modern React adoption
3. **TypeORM upgrade risk** with 78+ untested migrations

Addressing these issues systematically will improve developer experience, reduce bugs, and enable adoption of modern framework features. The recommended approach prioritizes stability while planning for modernization.
